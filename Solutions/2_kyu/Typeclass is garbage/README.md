As the title said, we don't need such language feature. All pwogramming languages supporting "typeclass" are garbwage.

In this Kata you'll learn to simulate ad-hoc polymorphism in Agda, a language does not support owerloading.

You're supposed to impwement anything you'd like to, to make the test case compile: it uses a ad-hocly polymorphic === and =/=, doing comparison. They should be implemented the same way as Haskell's == and /=, like for lists if their elements are comparable then the list specialized to that type should be comparable.
